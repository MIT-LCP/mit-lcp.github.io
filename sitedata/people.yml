    biog: "Dr. Mark is Distinguished Professor of Health Sciences and Technology in the Institute of Medical Engineering and Science at MIT. He received the SB and PhD degrees in EE from MIT, and the MD degree from Harvard Medical School. He trained in internal medicine at the Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital, and then spent two years in the Medical Corps of the USAF studying the biological effects of laser radiation. He joined the faculty of the EE Department at MIT in 1969, and also the faculty of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has been active in teaching cardiovascular pathophysiology to HST students, and quantitative physiology to undergraduate biomedical engineering students at MIT. Dr. Mark is a fellow of the IEEE, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology, and a founding fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. He conducts research aimed at improving health care through the generation of new knowledge, monitoring technology and clinical decision support by applying physiological signal processing, data science and machine learning to large collections of critical care data."
  - name: Leo Celi
    image: "leo_celi.jpg"
    biog: "Dr. Celi directs all the interdisciplinary clinical research of the lab and mentors many young clinicians who collaborate with the core engineering staff on research projects. He is a physician with board certifications in internal medicine, infectious disease and critical care medicine. He also holds master’s degrees in Biomedical Informatics (MIT) and Public Health (Harvard). He is Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Principal Research Scientist at MIT. He actively attends and teaches in the Medical Intensive Care Units at BIDMC during 6 weeks each year. He teaches two MIT courses—HST.936 Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care, and HST.953 Secondary Analysis of Health Data and oversees efforts to transition the course into a massive open online course under edX. His research interest is in data mining and the application of machine learning on large databases. He works with MIMIC, the publicly-available de-identified ICU database from BIDMC. He is working on a data-driven decision support system known as Collective Experience that (1) allows a clinician to draw on the experience of other clinicians who have taken care of similar patients as recorded in a clinical database, and (2) uses models performed on relatively homogeneous patient subsets."
  - name: Alistair Johnson
    image: "alistair_johnson.jpg"
    biog: "Alistair joined the Laboratory for Computational Physiology in 2015 and is currently a full time Research Scientist. He received his B.Eng in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University, Canada, and subsequently read for a D.Phil in Healthcare Innovation at the University of Oxford. His thesis was titled \"Mortality and acuity assessment in critical care\", and its focus included using machine learning techniques to predict mortality and develop new severity of illness scores for patients admitted to intensive care units. Before joining the LCP, Alistair spent a year as a research assistant at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he worked on building early alerting models for patients post-ICU discharge. He has extensive experience and expertise in working with ICU data, and in building decision support tools for critically ill patients. He is actively engaged in research investigations with clinical colleagues. He has worked extensively on creating and releasing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and eICU databases, and in actively supporting its user community."
  - name: Li-wei Lehman

    biog: "Dr. Li-wei Lehman is a full-time Research Scientist in the Laboratory for Computational Physiology (LCP) at the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES). Her research focuses on machine learning for physiological dynamics modelling and informed clinical decision making. She is a member of PhysioNet, which is an NIH-funded project on Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals. She received her Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, and her Ph.D. from MIT."
  - name: Tom Pollard
    image: "tpollard.jpg"
    biog: "Tom earned his PhD in biomedical engineering at University College London and University College London Hospitals (UCLH) where he obtained focused experience in the intensive care environment and computational modeling of patient physiology. He is currently a full time Research Scientist at MIT. He is expert in the development, support, and analysis of critical care databases, including MIMIC and the recently released eICU Collaborative Research Database. He conducts retrospective studies in collaboration with clinical specialists, develops and supports critical care databases that are widely used around the world in research and education, and he has created software used by hundreds of researchers and students internationally. Tom has a broad interest in how we can improve the way that critical care data is managed, shared, and analyzed for the benefit of patients. He is a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute and a Member of the MIT Task Force on Open Access."
  - name: Jesse Raffa
    image: "jraffa.jpg"
    biog: "Dr. Jesse Raffa, PhD, is a biostatistician Research Scientist at MIT and provides statistical and epidemiological expertise to the group. His primary area of interest in methodological research has been the analysis of complex longitudinal data, in particular using different types of latent variable structures. This is highly relevant in the critical care setting, where most data is both longitudinal and complex in nature. He provides study design and analytical support for LCP’s clinical collaborations both as a consultant and data analyst."
  - name: Benjamin Moody
    image: "kepaik.png"
    biog: "Mr. Benjamin Moody is a scientific programmer with extensive experience in physiologic signal processing. He manages the acquisition, reformatting, de-identification and archiving of the physiologic waveform data that accumulates continuously at a rate of 400 GB (3,000 waveform records) per month! The data is collected from all patients in the ICUs and NICUs at BIDMC by the Philips monitors. The waveforms are archived by the Philips Data Warehouse Connect system, and are transmitted to MIT via a VPN network connection. Mr. Moody extracts the data, reformats it into wfdb flat files, de-identifies and time-shifts it, and ultimately matches it to associated clinical data."
  - name: Kenneth Paik
