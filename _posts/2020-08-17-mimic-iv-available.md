## MIMIC-IV Database Release

We are delighted to announce that MIMIC-IV has been [published on PhysioNet](https://doi.org/10.13026/a3wn-hq05). MIMIC-IV, the latest version of MIMIC, is a database comprising comprehensive clinical information on hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. Major changes from [MIMIC-III](https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26) include: (1) a modular structure that links core hospital data to multiple data sources, including chest x-ray images; (2) an approach to date shifting that provides approximate year of admission; (3) new sources of data; such as the electronic medicine administration record.

The dataset is available from PhysioNet, and access is managed in the same way as MIMIC-III. If you already have access to MIMIC-III, then you will be granted access after signing the Data Use Agreement. New users will need to complete the credentialing process first (see: [https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/access/](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/access/) for more details).
