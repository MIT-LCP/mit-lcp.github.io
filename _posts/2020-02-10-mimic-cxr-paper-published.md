## MIMIC-CXR Paper Published

A journal article describing the MIMIC-CXR database was recently published in *Scientific Data*. The article provides detail regarding the collection, curation, and processing done in order to create the database. The article is open access and available online [1].

The database has also been preprocessed into compressed JPG format images, which have been made available on PhysioNet as the [MIMIC-CXR-JPG Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/). The database includes labels extracted from the free-text reports using publicly available tools.
